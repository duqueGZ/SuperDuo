**** ALEXANDRIA ****

 - Included barcode scanner functionality. Implemented by using a library (not directly calling to another external app). Implementation
   based on googlesamples/android-vision example (https://github.com/googlesamples/android-vision.git).
 - Fixed error that made the app crash when searching a new book without network connection. Introduced the use of SharedPreferences saved
   status.
 - Included internalization support. Included strings.xml both for default (in english) and for spanish versions.
 - Upgrade to 23 the targetSdkVersion (it was needed while implementing the barcode scanner functionality)
 - Detected and fixed a bug that made the app crash when switching screen orientation in Book Detail screen (due to the use of the 
   ShareIntent).
 - Detected a NetworkOnMainThreadException on app startup, caused by the use of code coverage tool, jacoco. So, this use has been 
   deactivated in the app current version.
 - Made some (just a little) refactorization and improvements (both in layout and logic part).

 --- Possible further tasks left as future work lines:
   > Analyze the problem caused by jacoco library and correctly include it in the project in order to get back the code coverage 
     functionality.
   > Implement a full test suite.
   > Change the use of DownloadImage AsyncTask in order to get book covers, in order to use a library such as Glide (more efficient 
     image loading, caching, etc.)
   > Continue improving the current version of the app code.
   > Optimize API calls.

**** FOOTBALL SCORES ****

 - Included two widgets: a simple one, that allows to see the info for the last or next match from your favourite team. And a more 
   complex one, a collection widget that allows to see the list of matches from a selected league (including matches for last, next or
   both weeks).
 - Included several missing content descriptions and improved several of those who already existed in the initial app version
 - Implemented layout mirroring support.
 - Included internalization support. Included strings.xml both for default (in english) and for spanish versions.
 - Change the way the app communicates with football-data.org API, in order to use a SyncAdapter (which is a better and simpler way to 
   get the data regularly and automatically updated.
 - Upgrade to 15 the minSdkVersion, as I think that it is a more suitable option and one that still covers the great majority of current 
   Android devices.
 - Made some refactorization (including the use of ButterKnife library in order to get a cleaner and more maintainable code), logic and
   layout code improvements, and also database model changes in order to get a more optimal version.

 --- Possible further tasks left as future work lines:
   > Implement a full test suite.
   > Improve the images loading, by using a library such as Glide (more efficient image loading, caching, etc.). In addition, implements 
     the support in order to directly obtain all the teams logos from the Internet (i.e., by using the crest urls provided by 
     football-data.org API).
   > Include support for a larger number of leagues and teams (the goal will be to support all the leagues available at football-data.org).
     Besides, include a settings screen where the user would be able to configure the leagues for which the info will be retrieved.
   > Continue improving the current version of the app code.
   > Optimize API calls.
